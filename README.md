## 1. Project Overview
This project is part of Udacity Nano Degree course assignment focusing on creating data exploration to later answer business questions, and create visualisations.

## 2. Project Components
There are two components in this project.
### 2.1 Preprocessing
Data will first be viewed and then cleansed. Cleansing this data is rather minimalist as it already sufficiently clean. Some minor procedures taken such as reformating data (i.e. from str to int), eleminating spaces in column name to provide ease in later data processing. Missing values are also re-format to have universal format across columns. 
### 2.2 Exploration
Data explored to answer 4 key questions, and later answered through visualisation using Plotly library. The questions are as follows, 
* What are the average variety and ratings for each brand?
* Which country has the highest competition?
* How strict a country judge a Ramen?
* What is the leading global brand?

## 3. Project Objective
This project created to provide ramen producer a sense of market concentration and customers view towards the product. Visualisation also designed to explore Plotly styling capablities to provide appealing output to answer the above questions. <a name="bw"></a>
